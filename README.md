## Approach and Difficulties

I have used plain HTML page and added Tailwind CSS CDN link in this HTML file within ```<head>``` tag. I also have added fontawesome CSS file CDN link for emoji. I added a simple script to open and close hamburger menu in small device view. I found difficulties in implementing the design from a PNG file. Instead of that a figma design link would have helped more. It is very difficult to get appropriate definition of Typography, css attributes from a PNG file.
